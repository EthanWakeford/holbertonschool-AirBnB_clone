#AirBnB Clone - The console
This AirBnB console works in interactive and non-interactive mode; this project is a basice copy of Air BnB.

#Command interpreter or console
This storage engine will give us and abstraction between "My object" and "How they are stored and persisted." This means: from your console code and from the front-end and RestAPI you'll build later, you wont have to pay attention to how your objects are stored.

#Starting it
use the following command to start the console: ./console/py

#How its used:
+ manage objects via console/command interprete
+ store and persist object to a file (JSON file)
+ Commands: create, show, destory, all, update, help, quit

#How to open:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
