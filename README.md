# Holberton School - AirBnB Clone

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project by Holberton School!

## Overview

The AirBnB Clone project is a simplified version of the popular Airbnb platform, designed to teach students about web development, backend architecture, and database management. The project consists of developing a command-line interface (CLI) and a web server that mimics the functionality of Airbnb's core features, such as listing properties, managing bookings, and user authentication.

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Interact with the application using a command-line interface for managing properties, users, bookings, and more.
- **Web Server:** Implement a RESTful API using Flask to handle HTTP requests and responses for the frontend interface.
- **Database Management:** Utilize SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQL database for storing and retrieving application data.
- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to application features.
- **Unit Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of different components and ensure code reliability.
- **Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation for the project, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and code documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional)
- **Database:** SQLite (for development), MySQL or PostgreSQL (for production)
- **Testing:** Pytest

#AirBnB Clone - The console
This AirBnB console works in interactive and non-interactive mode; this project is a basice copy of Air BnB.

#Command interpreter or console
This storage engine will give us and abstraction between "My object" and "How they are stored and persisted." This means: from your console code and from the front-end and RestAPI you'll build later, you wont have to pay attention to how your objects are stored.

#Starting it
use the following command to start the console: ./console/py

#How its used:
+ Manage objects via console/command interprete
+ Store and persist object to a file (JSON file)
+ Commands: create, show, destory, all, update, help, quit

#How to open:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$

Example: Create object 
(hbnb) create User
